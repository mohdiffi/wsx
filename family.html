<h1><font face="Lucida Handwriting" style="font-size :80%">Being together with family is a special happiness for me where we can talk and laugh with the people we love. All that passed, the time to get together with the family started to dwindle as a result of my siblings starting to get married and after the death of my late mother. I am the eighth child of nine siblings and have five sisters and two brothers and one brother. Even though we are far apart, we often quarrel. "As the saying goes; like a cat with a dog. But my family is always there when I fall and get up. The happiest day for my family was on Eid al-Fitr but the happiness diminished a little after the death of my mother.At the same time it did not break the friendship between my siblings.In conclusion, there are many benefits we can afford when practicing family values in daily life. This situation can ensure that the life we live in the future is more quality and meaningful because we have a family that causes a person to continue his life. Therefore, society should not be indifferent to these noble values so that they can give birth to a perfect family.No matter how busy you are, no matter how far you go, family is your home. Money and popularity can't afford to be with family.</h1></font>
